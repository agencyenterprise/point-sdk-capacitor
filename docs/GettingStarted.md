# Getting Started

Learn how to configure you project and start using the SDK

## Install

```bash
npm install point-sdk-capacitor
npx cap sync
```

## Setting Up your Project

**Before start using Point SDK, you must perform the following changes to your Xcode project settings:**

1. Enable **HealthKit capabilities** in your app.

2. Add permissions configuration

### Enable HealthKit capabilities

In Xcode, select the project and add the HealthKit capability.
It is highly recommended that you also enable **Background Delivery** and **Background fetch** capabilities.
![Project capabilities.](Project-config.png)
For a detailed discussion about enabling Health Kit capabilities, see [Configure HealthKit](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev1a5823416) at the official Xcode Help.

### Permissions configuration

You must provide a message to the user explaining why the app is requesting permission to read samples from the HealthKit store.
To do so, set the [NSHealthShareUsageDescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nshealthshareusagedescription) key to customize this message.
For projects created using Xcode 13 or later, set these keys in the Target Properties list on the appâ€™s Info tab.
For projects created with Xcode 12 or earlier, set these keys in the apps Info.plist file.
For more information, see [Information Property List](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list).

## Setting Up Point SDK

In order to set up and start using Point, you must perform the following steps:

1. Initialize the SDK.

2. Request **User Permission** for reading the selected Apple Health data types.

3. Set user access token.

### Initializing Point SDK

Before any feature can be used, you must initialize the SDK providing your credentials and every Health Data Type you wish to use. For more information about the supported data types, please refer to `HealthQueryType`.

It is recommended to do it at the start of your application.

```typescript
setupSDK() {
    PointSDK.setup({
        clientId: "clientID",
        clientSecret: "clientSecret",
        environment: PointEnvironment.Development,
        queryTypes: [
            QueryType.HeartRate,
            QueryType.StepCount,
            QueryType.Workout,
            QueryType.ActiveEnergyBurned,
            QueryType.BasalEnergyBurned,
        ],
        verbose: true,
    });
}
```

> Important: Sending an empty array of types will disable all data collecting and <doc:PointHealthKit> features.

> Important: Important: Using **verbose: true** will make the SDK print logs in the debug console about internal operations, filters, dates, errors, warnings and much more. This is helpful during development/integration phase, but we recommend turning it off before releasing your app into production.

### Requesting User Permissions

Request user permissions for all `HealthQueryType` defined at SDK setup. It is recommended to do it before setting the user token or attempting to evoke other SDK methods.

```typescript
async requestPermissions() {
    await PointSDK.requestAuthorizationsIfPossible();
}
```

### Setting User's Access Token

Set the user access token. It is recommended to do it as soon as possible, right after having requested user permissions.

```typescript
async setUserToken() {
    await PointSDK.setUserToken({ userToken: token });
}
```

> Note: The setUserToken function automatically triggers a Latest Data sync and also Historical Data sync if it's the first usage during that session. Refer to <doc:PointHealthKit> for more information about uploading data.

> Note: For more details about user authentication, refer to [Authenticating Users](AuthenticatingUsers.md)

## Collecting and uploading samples

Use the <doc:PointHealthKit> to collect and upload health samples and basic user data to Point Database.

## Retrieving user data and generated metrics

Use the <doc:PointAPI> to retrieve user data and generated metrics such as recommendations, trends, workouts, health metrics and more.
